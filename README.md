# STEM Job Market Analysis

This project analyzes labor market returns to STEM, STEM-adjacent, and non-STEM occupations using microdata from the 2023 Current Population Survey (CPS). The analysis explores how demographic and employment characteristics—such as gender, race, education, and citizenship—relate to occupational choice and income, with a special focus on foreign-born workers.

## 📊 Summary

- **Language**: Python  
- **Data**: 2023 CPS (IPUMS-CPS), 2018 STEM occupation code list  
- **Methods**: Cross-tabulation, OLS regression, subgroup comparison  
- **Report Date**: May 2025  


## 📄 Methodology

- Filtered ~63,000 working-age individuals from the 2023 CPS
- Defined STEM, STEM-adjacent, and non-STEM occupations using the 2018 Census STEM list
- Conducted OLS regression to estimate income differentials
- Explored subgroup variations by gender, race, education, and citizenship
- Focused on correlational patterns, not causal inference

## 🔍 Key Findings

- STEM workers earn **more than double** the median annual income of non-STEM workers ($95,750 vs. $46,000)
- Foreign-born workers are more likely to work in STEM fields—and see **larger income gains** from STEM jobs than U.S.-born workers
- Gender gaps persist: women are more represented in STEM-related roles than in core STEM
- STEM participation increases significantly with **education level** and is concentrated in **full-time, mid-career** roles
